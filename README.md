# UU_research_network
This script is to make and visualize a network graph of researchers + research topics at Uppsala University, like to the example here:

![IEGNetwork](https://github.com/bobmuscarella/UU_research_network/blob/master/Images/IEG_network_ex1.pdf "IEGNetwork")

This was developed using the tutorial on network graph visualization by Katherine Ognyanova, ["Network visualization with R"](https://kateto.net/).

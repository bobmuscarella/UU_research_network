# Research Networks at Uppsala University

This script is to make and visualize a network graph of researchers + research topics, like this example:

![IEGnetwork](https://github.com/bobmuscarella/UU_research_network/blob/master/Images/IEG_network_ex1.png?raw=true "IEGnetwork")

I developed the script using the tutorial by Katherine Ognyanova, ["Network visualization with R"](https://kateto.net/).

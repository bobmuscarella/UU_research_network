# Research Networks at Uppsala University

This script is to make and visualize a network graph of researchers + research topics, like the example below. The idea is that perhaps this type of graphic can help make researchers from different programs (or, eventually, different departments) more aware about colleagues who are doing similar work at Uppsala University. In this case, the network is based on the words that occur in publication titles (scraped from Google Scholar) for each person. However, it would be easy to use different text as inputs (e.g., user-supplied keywords).

I developed the script using the tutorial by Katherine Ognyanova, ["Network visualization with R"](https://kateto.net/).

# Research Networks at Uppsala University

This script is to make and visualize a network graph of researchers + research topics, like this example:

![IEGnetwork](https://github.com/bobmuscarella/UU_research_network/blob/master/Images/IEG_network_ex1.png?raw=true "IEGnetwork")

In this case, the network is based on the words that occur in publication titles (scraped from Google Scholar) for each person.  It would be quite easy to use different text as inputs (e.g., user-supplied keywords).

I developed the script using the tutorial by Katherine Ognyanova, ["Network visualization with R"](https://kateto.net/).

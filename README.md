# UU_research_network
This script is to make and visualize a network graph of researchers + research topics at Uppsala University, like to the example here:

![IEG network](https://github.com/UU_research_network/IEG_network_ex1.pdf/IEG_network_ex1.pdf "IEG network")

This was developed using the tutorial on network graph visualization by Katherine Ognyanova, ["Network visualization with R"](https://kateto.net/).
